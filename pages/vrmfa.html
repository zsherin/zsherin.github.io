			This was a class project with three other MIT students. To quote our design document's mission statement: </br>
			<p class="quote">
			The vr-mfa is a virtual reality art museum which is randomly generated every day and whose pieces are randomly selected from the online amateur art community, DeviantArt. It aims to democratize museum display space and to both be a place for Deviantart artists and users to admire the work of the community. This project was inspired by the following observation: Since museums have limited space in their galleries, curators must judge which pieces are displayed, and this tends to favor professional artists. So, the vr-mfa aims to complement traditional museums by creating a new virtual museum every day (to address the issue of limited space), catering to amateur artists, and using randomization to reduce human bias when selecting artwork. Through this, vr-mfa hopes to encourage museums to think about alternative approaches to curation, about techniques for presenting artwork, and about the amateur artist community.

			This project was a lot of fun, and the team I worked with made an amazing finished product. The video above is a video of what a user sees when they walk around the museum in a Google Cardboard headset. The museum randomly generates a layout with certain locations for artwork, and then randomly selects images to fill those locations from a cached selection of art. This art is pulled every day, so the museum rebuilds itself physically and changes its display every 24 hours. Currently, the project is not hosted anywhere, so it is not possible to get a copy of the vrmfa. However, the server is hosted on <a href= "https://github.com/hariharsubramanyam/vrmfa-backend">Github</a> and the front end Unity game can be found on <a href="https://github.com/zsherin/vrmfa-frontend">my Github</a>. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions on the project.
