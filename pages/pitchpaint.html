			Conceived of and built in a single thirty-six hour period at the <a href=http://www.realityvirtuallyhack.com/> Reality, Virtuality Hackathon</a>, this virtual reality experience allows users to create looping sample tracks by drawing in the space around them. By drawing from low to high, the pitch of their chosen sample changes, and the speed with which they draw determines the tempo of their chosen track. Overall, it provides an intuitive method of composing music a that also ends with an abstract sculpture to complement their musical creation. </br>

			Not only am I extremely proud of the work that the Vream Team (our hackathon team name) completed in such a short time, but we were honoroed to get the Audience Favorite prize, and second place in the entertainment and games category. It was the first time I've ever won a big novelty check! This team consisted of myself and four other members, one of whom, Emily, you can see speaking in the video above. Emily and I led the charge on this project, both in development and design, but without the other team members it would not look, sound, or feel nearly as excellent. If you are interested in how this works, the code for the project is available online at <a href= "https://github.com/emvanb/vreamteam">Emily's github</a>. The Vream Team plans to continue work on the project, so if you're interested, keep your eyes peeled!
