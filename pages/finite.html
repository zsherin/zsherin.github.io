			<b>Important note: I had nothing to do with the video above. However, this paper came out a little after I finished my work on this project, and it accomplishes the same goals. It concisely explains everything I did in my project, though theirs is certainly more production-ready. All credit goes to those listed in the video who made this work.</b></br></br>At the end of a class at MIT on <a href="http://cfg.mit.edu/content/6s079-computational-fabrication"> computational fabrication</a>, I wanted to create a project using Finite Element Analysis. FEA is the way we simulate stress on objects. Whether its force deformation, heat transfer, or anything, really. Given a 3D model of an object and its material properties, you can simulate what will happen when it is pushed on by any force. Let's say that you have a toy that you want to make out of a soft rubber. It's possible, if the object is thin and standing up, that it will deform from its original pose (what I call the rest pose). That means that after all that work to design an attractive pose, your object droops in some way.

			To fix this problem, I wrote a piece of software that finds a 3D model that, when it comes to rest against gravity, looks like the original model you fed it. Based on material properties and finite element simulations, the program uses Newton's Method of optimization (a fancy way of iteratively solving a problem until our answer is good enough) to produce a model that vaguely resembles the original model. The important part is when it is placed under the stress of gravity, the new model will come to rest in the pose of the original input model. With this program, you no longer have to worry about your design deforming when manufactured, as the computer has already done the work for you.
