			The video above shows it best. <i>A Slower Speed of Light</i> is a short, surreal game that quietly simulates the effects of traveling at the speed of light. This is still my favorite project; a beautiful game that has inspired some to look deeper into physics. It's a fun, easy example of using games to interest people in a topic they may not have known about. I was one of two developers on the project. Over eight weeks we worked with one artist (and a host of support from the MIT-GAMBIT Game Lab, where this was made) to create game using an engine the two of us had developed over a semester.

			 Afterwards, the tools used to build the game were made into a toolkit called OpenRelativity, which is available freely online for use with the Unity game engine. For a more in depth explanation of the physics, or to download the game or the OpenRelativity toolkit, please visit the MIT Game Lab <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/">website</a>, which is the true home of the game.
